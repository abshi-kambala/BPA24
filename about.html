      <h1>About Stage Fright</h1>
      <p>We're Stage Fright, a rock band that came together in 2023 to share our passion for music with the world. From the very beginning, our goal has been to create songs that not only resonate with us but also connect with everyone who listens.

        Since forming, we've collaborated to write music that tells our story and our love for rock. Performing live has been one of the most exciting parts of our journey, and we've had the honor of sharing our sound with audiences at various events.
        Thank you for checking us out! We're so excited to have you along for the ride, and we hope you stick around and tune into our concerts. Let's make some noise together!</p>

            <p class="summary">Abish Kambala</p>
            <p class="details hidden">
              Abish is the voice of Stage Fright. With a dynamic vocal range and a knack for writing lyrics that hit deep, he brings every song to life. As the band's rhythm guitarist, Abish lays down solid grooves that hold everything together.
              Off-stage, he's always coming up with creative ideas to keep the music fresh.

          <p class="summary" >Atharva Kumar</p>
          <p class="details hidden">
            Atharva delivers electrifying solos and riffs that define the band's sound. His technical skills and passion for experimenting with new styles push Stage Fright to the next level.
             When he's not destroying his guitar, he's the band's biggest cheerleader, hyping everyone up before shows and cracking jokes to keep the vibe alive.

          <p class="summary" >Vedant Bhatia</p>
          <p class="details hidden">
            Vedant is the powerhouse driving Stage Fright's rhythm. Whether it's a thunderous anthem or a slow-burning ballad, his beats set the pace and bring the energy. 
            Known for his relentless energy, he's the one who makes sure every performance is tight. Outside of drumming, Vedant keeps the band grounded and focused, balancing the chaos with his calm, determined attitude.
